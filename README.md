### Hi there, I'm Max ðŸ‘‹

#### Trade
I'm a full-stack software engineer from Berlin. I mostly work with TypeScript and React (Native), but consider myself a general technologist who can pick up new languages and skills quickly. 

#### Passion
My job title may be "software engineer", but at heart I'm an entrepreneur. I love building products from scratch and sweating the details. There's nothing I get more satisfaction from than people being delighted by the products I built. If you'd like to work with me, please check out [ast.sh](https://ast.sh/), my personal product studio through which I build products for clients and ship my own products.

#### Curiosity
After many years of working on web applications, I'm currently diving deep into the React Native ecosystem. I enjoy having the ability to ship a product to multiple platforms, while still leveraging each platform's unique capabilities. I recently [contributed to the ecosystem](https://x.com/maximilianast/status/1759283175732249041?s=46), by publishing [expo-share-extension](https://github.com/MaxAst/expo-share-extension), a plugin that makes it easy to create iOS share extensions for React Native apps that are built with [Expo](https://expo.dev/).
